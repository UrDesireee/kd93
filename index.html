            <div class="falling-text">Hello Everyone. Desire Here, I know some of you hate me, some of you do not want to know me, and some of you love me, but let's put the past behind :3 <br/><br/>
                This was a project for a 3493 Kingdom Site, but I got told that a 96 king making a site for their enemy was weird, so I stopped and someone else started making a new site. How did the new site turn out? I have no idea :D <br/><br/>
                Anyway, now the website is made for some <b>QOL</b> stuff, like DKP calculator, Ruins and Altars Times, as well as a Chronicle Calendar, all those things can help you plan on what time you need to be on or how much DKP You need to gain<br/><br/>
                I hope the site helps you all if you have any new ideas for what I can add here, message me on Discord <br/><br/>(discord: urdesireee )
